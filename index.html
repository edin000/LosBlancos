      Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the
      Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates. They founded
      (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in
      Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and
      create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky
      Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós
      and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901 this new club was
      renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as "New Foot-Ball
      Club". On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football
      Club was officially founded.

      Three years after its foundation, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the
      Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January
      1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between
      grounds the team moved to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912. In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid
      after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.

      In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last
      match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona. Real Madrid won its first
      League title in the 1931–32 season and retained the title the following year.

      On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and went back
      to being named Madrid Football Club. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943 Madrid
      beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of a semi-final of the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa del Rey having
      been renamed in honour of General Franco. It has been suggested Barcelona players were intimidated by police,
      including by the director of state security who "allegedly told the team that some of them were only playing
      because of the regime's generosity in permitting them to remain in the country." The Barcelona chairman,
      Enrique Piñeyro, was assaulted by Madrid fans. However, none of these allegations have been proven and FIFA
      and UEFA still consider the result as legitimate. According to Spanish journalist and writer, Juan Carlos
      Pasamontes, Barcelona player Josep Valle denied that the Spanish security forces came before the match.
      Instead, at the end of the first half, Barcelona coach Juan José Nogués and all of his players were angry with the
      hard-style of play Real Madrid was using and with the aggressiveness of the home crowd.[29] When they refused to
      take the field, the Superior Chief of Police of Madrid appeared, identified himself, and ordered the team to take
      the field.
