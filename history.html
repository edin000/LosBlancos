            Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the
            Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates. They
            founded
            (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in
            Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to
            leave and
            create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky
            Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan
            Padrós
            and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901 this new club
            was
            renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as "New Foot-Ball
            Club". On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football
            Club was officially founded.

            Madrid FC team in 1906
            Three years after its foundation, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in
            the
            Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4
            January
            1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving
            between
            grounds the team moved to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912. In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real
            Madrid
            after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.
            <br>
            <br>
            In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the
            last
            match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona. Real Madrid won its first
            League title in the 1931–32 season and retained the title the following year.
            <br>
            <br>
            On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and went
            back
            to being named Madrid Football Club. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943
            Madrid
            beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of a semi-final[25] of the Copa del Generalísimo, the Copa del Rey
            having
            been renamed in honour of General Franco. It has been suggested Barcelona players were intimidated by
            police,
            including by the director of state security who "allegedly told the team that some of them were only playing
            because of the regime's generosity in permitting them to remain in the country." The Barcelona chairman,
            Enrique Piñeyro, was assaulted by Madrid fans. However, none of these allegations have been proven and FIFA
            and UEFA still consider the result as legitimate. According to Spanish journalist and writer, Juan Carlos
            Pasamontes, Barcelona player Josep Valle denied that the Spanish security forces came before the match.
            Instead, at the end of the first half, Barcelona coach Juan José Nogués and all of his players were angry
            with the
            hard-style of play Real Madrid was using and with the aggressiveness of the home crowd.[29] When they
            refused to
            take the field, the Superior Chief of Police of Madrid appeared, identified himself, and ordered the team to
            take
            the field.

        <h1 class="Santiago">Santiago Bernabéu and European success (1945–1978)</h1>

        <p class="Story">
            Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1945. Under his presidency, the club, its stadium
            Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva were rebuilt after the
            Spanish Civil War damages. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo
            founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or "cantera," known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked
            upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.
            <br> <br>

            In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe,
            Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created a tournament for the champions teams around Europe, under
            invitation, that would eventually become what today is known as the UEFA Champions League. It was under
            Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European
            football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3
            Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. After these five consecutive successes, Real was
            permanently awarded the original cup and earning the right to wear the UEFA badge of honor. <br> <br> <br>

            The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966 defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a
            team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition. This team became known
            as the Yé-yé. The name "Yé-yé" came from the "Yeah, yeah, yeah" chorus in The Beatles' song "She Loves You"
            after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles. The Yé-yé generation was
            also European Cup runners-up in 1962 and 1964. In the 1970s, Real Madrid won five league
            championships and three Spanish Cups. The club played its first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final in 1971 and
            lost to English side Chelsea 2–1. On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World
            Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the
            tournament. The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in
            memory of its former president.

            Raúl holds the record for most Real Madrid appearances, having played 741 first-team matches from 1994 to
            2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis, Jr., having played 710
            times. The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 170 caps (167
            while at the club), Sergio Ramos is Real's most capped international player. <br> <br> 

            Cristiano Ronaldo is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals. Six other players have
            also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–64), Santillana (1971–88), Ferenc Puskás
            (1958–66), Hugo Sánchez (1985–92), Karim Benzema (2009–current) and the previous goalscoring record-holder
            Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48
            in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di
            Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it
            was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals. The fastest goal in the
            history of the club (12 seconds) was scored by the Brazilian Ronaldo on 3 December 2003 during a league
            match against Atlético Madrid. <br> <br> <br>

            Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 83,329, which was for a Copa del
            Rey match in 2006. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 81,044. The club's average
            attendance in the 2007–08 season was 76,234, the highest in European Leagues.[150] Real has also set records
            in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (34 as of 2019–20) and the most seasons won in a
            row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90). With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the
            club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga. <br> <br> <br>


            The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League thirteen times and
            for the most semi-final appearances . As of December 2019, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer
            in the UEFA Champions League, with 128 (129 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real
            Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became
            the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70. Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game
            winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record and fourth worldwide.
            The same season the team tied the win-streak for games in the Champions League, with ten. In September
            2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd
            consecutive game.

            In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of
            football by agreeing to pay Manchester United €94 million (£80 million) for the services of Cristiano
            Ronaldo. The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus
            to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had
            been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67
            million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world
            record signing, with the transfer fee reported at around €100 million. In January 2016, documents
            pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.
            Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club reportedly signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea
            for €100 million. The club's sale record came on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo
            for €100 million.
